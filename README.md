This is a demo example showing how to make use of QQmlObjectListModel, which is a generic model for ListView in QML. It is a very efficient way of manipulating the list model data.

The original source for the implementation is at:

https://github.com/Cavewhere/lib-qt-qml-tricks

However, the test code has some problems for it.
